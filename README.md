# **MedVault** 🛡️🏥

## **Secure Patient Data Management System with Context-Aware Access Control**

## **Overview**

MedVault is a cutting-edge web application designed to demonstrate advanced cybersecurity principles in healthcare data management. Unlike traditional systems with static security, MedVault implements **Context-Aware Access Control (CAAC)** that dynamically adjusts user permissions based on real-time factors like time, location, device, and user behavior patterns.

This project serves as both a functional prototype and an educational platform for understanding how modern security controls can protect sensitive healthcare data while maintaining usability for medical professionals.

## **✨ Key Features**

### **🔐 Advanced Security Controls**
- **Context-Aware Access Control (CAAC):** Dynamic permissions based on time, location, and device context
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Four distinct user roles (Patient, Nurse, Doctor, Administrator)
- **AES-256 Encryption:** Field-level encryption for sensitive patient data (Age, Condition, Contact Info)
- **Granular Data Masking:** Role-specific data visibility (Admins see all, Doctors see medical, Nurses see basic info)
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Immutable logs with full context capture

### **🎓 Educational Demonstrations**
- **Hack Mode vs Secure Mode:** Toggle between vulnerable and protected states
- **Live Security Visualization:** Real-time dashboard showing security decisions
- **Attack Simulation:** Pre-built scenarios demonstrating security effectiveness
- **Interactive Learning:** Step-by-step security concept explanations

### **🏥 Healthcare-Specific Design**
- **Emergency Override:** Controlled break-glass access for critical situations
- **HIPAA Compliance Features:** Built-in privacy and security controls
- **Medical Workflow Integration:** Security that adapts to healthcare realities

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medvault.git
   cd medvault
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Backend (.env)
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   ```

5. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Use demo credentials to explore different roles

## **👥 User Roles & Access**

### **Nurse**
- View basic patient identification (Name, Ward, Age)
- **Privacy Control:** Sensitive medical & contact details are masked (`****`)
- Emergency patient management capabilities (Requests)

### **Doctor**
- View patient medical records (Condition, Ward, Age)
- **Privacy Control:** Personal contact information is masked (`****`)
- Context-aware restrictions for external access

### **Administrator**
- Full access to decrypted patient details (via "View Encrypted Details")
- User management (Doctors, Nurses, Patients)
- Security policy management
- Audit log review and analysis
- Demonstration mode control

## **📊 Context-Aware Security**

MedVault evaluates four context dimensions to make dynamic security decisions:

### **Temporal Context**
- Time of day and business hours
- Emergency periods vs normal operations
- Shift patterns and typical access times

### **Spatial Context**
- Network location and IP geolocation
- Hospital internal vs external access
- Trusted vs untrusted locations

### **Device Context**
- Device fingerprint and registration status
- Corporate vs personal devices
- New device detection and response

### **Behavioral Context**
- User access pattern analysis
- Typical workflow sequences
- Anomaly detection and risk scoring

## **🎯 Demonstration Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Nurse After-Hours Access**
Demonstrates how context restrictions prevent unauthorized access during off-hours while allowing emergency work.

### **Scenario 2: External Doctor Access**
Shows context-triggered MFA and restricted functionality when accessing from outside the hospital network.

### **Scenario 3: Insider Threat Detection**
Illustrates how behavioral analysis identifies suspicious access patterns even with valid credentials.

### **Scenario 4: Emergency Override**
Demonstrates controlled break-glass access during critical patient care situations.
