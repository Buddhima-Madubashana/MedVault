# **MedVault** 🛡️🏥

## **Secure Patient Data Management System with Context-Aware Access Control**

## **Overview**

MedVault is a full-stack web application designed to demonstrate advanced cybersecurity principles in healthcare data management. Unlike traditional systems with static security, MedVault implements **Context-Aware Access Control (CAAC)** that dynamically adjusts user permissions based on real-time factors such as **shift schedules**, **leave status**, and **temporary privilege escalation**.

The system enforces **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** across three primary roles — **Administrator**, **Doctor**, and **Nurse** — with additional contextual dimensions including **Temporary Admin** privileges, **Off-Time (Shift-Based) restrictions**, and **Leave Day access blocking**. All sensitive patient data is protected with **AES-256 field-level encryption** and **role-specific data masking**.

---

## **✨ Key Features**

### **🔐 Advanced Security Controls**
- **Context-Aware Access Control (CAAC):** Shift-based access windows dynamically restrict write/edit privileges for Doctors and Nurses when outside active shift hours.
- **Leave Day Access Blocking:** Users on approved leave are blocked from system login entirely, unless an emergency override is granted by an Administrator.
- **Temporary Admin Escalation:** Doctors can request time-limited admin permissions that automatically expire after a configured duration.
- **Active Session Self-Defense:** Automated idle lock screen (admin-configurable inactivity timeout) that blurs the workstation and requires user activity to resume.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Three distinct user roles (Administrator, Doctor, Nurse) with granular permissions.
- **AES-256 Field-Level Encryption:** Sensitive patient fields (Age, Disease, Ward, Email, Phone, Address, Guardian Name) are encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC.
- **Role-Specific Data Masking:** Contact information is masked (`****`) for Doctors and Nurses; only Admins (and active Temporary Admins) see fully decrypted data.
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Immutable logs capturing user ID, name, role, action type, details, IP address, and timestamp for every significant event.
- **Account Lockout Protection:** Configurable max failed login attempts with automatic account lockout and Admin notification.
- **Password Policy Enforcement:** Admin-configurable minimum password length and special character requirements, with forced password reset on policy tightening.
- **Session Expiry:** JWT-based session management with configurable timeouts (Admins: 24h, Doctors/Nurses: admin-configurable).

### **🏥 Healthcare-Specific Design**
- **Patient Admission/Discharge Workflow:** Nurses submit patient requests (Add/Delete) that require Doctor approval before taking effect.
- **Treatment Timeline:** Doctors can add timeline entries and update medical history, status, and vitals for patients.
- **Task Assignment:** Doctors can assign tasks to Nurses with notification support.
- **Emergency Access Override:** Administrators can grant time-limited emergency access to staff members on approved leave.
- **Announcements System:** Admin-managed announcements with priority levels (Low, Normal, High) visible to all staff.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** In-app notification bell with unread count, individual/bulk mark-as-read, and deep-link navigation.

### **🔵 Doctor**

Doctors have clinical-level access focused on patient medical records. Their write access is **shift-dependent** — outside assigned shift hours, Doctors operate in **read-only mode**.

| Category | Permission | In Shift | Off Shift |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | View Dashboard Analytics & Statistics | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | View patient records (contact info masked as `****`) | ✅ | ✅ |

| **Patient Data** | Edit patient medical history | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Update patient status | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Update patient vitals (Heart Rate, BP, Temperature) | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Add treatment timeline entries | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Add new patients directly | ✅ | ❌ |

| **Leave Management** | View own leave request history | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Notifications** | Receive notifications (request approvals, task completions, permission updates) | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Note:** If no shift is assigned to a Doctor, they default to **unrestricted** (always in-shift) access.

---

### **🩷 Nurse**

Nurses have limited clinical access focused on patient intake, vitals updates, and request submission. Their write access is also **shift-dependent**.

| Category | Permission | In Shift | Off Shift |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | View Dashboard Analytics & Statistics | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | View patient records (contact info masked as `****`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | View patient medical history (read-only) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | View patient vitals & treatment timeline | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | Update patient vitals only (Heart Rate, BP, Temperature) | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Edit patient medical history | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Update patient status | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Patient Data** | Add treatment timeline entries | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Patient Requests** | Submit patient admission requests (to Doctor for approval) | ✅ | ❌ |

| **Leave Management** | Apply for leave | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Leave Management** | View own leave request history | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Notifications** | Receive notifications (request approvals/rejections, task assignments) | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Note:** Nurses can **never** edit medical history, change patient status, or add timeline entries — even when in shift. They are restricted to vitals updates only.

---

### **🟡 Temporary Admin (Doctor with Elevated Privileges)**

When a Doctor is granted temporary admin access, their account is **promoted to the Admin portal** with a combined permission set. The temporary admin operates in the Admin dashboard with an additional "Doctor Access" section in the sidebar.

| Category | Permission | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | View Dashboard Analytics & Statistics | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | View patient records (fully decrypted, unmasked) | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | All Doctor clinical permissions (edit history, vitals, timeline, status) | ✅ |
| **Patient Data** | Manage Patients (Add/Edit) & Delete Patient Records | ✅ |
| **Approvals** | Review and approve/reject Nurse requests | ✅ |
| **User Management** | View All Users list & Unlock locked accounts | ✅ |
| **User Management** | Register / Add new users | ❌ (Forbidden) |
| **Security** | View Audit Logs & Permission Matrix | ✅ |
| **Announcements** | Create, update, and delete announcements | ✅ |
| **Staff Directory** | View Nurse list & Doctor list | ✅ |
| **Leave Management** | View leave requests | ✅ (Read-only) |
| **Leave Management** | Approve/reject leave requests from other users | ❌ (Forbidden) |
| **Admin Requests** | Review/accept temp admin requests from other doctors | ❌ (Forbidden) |
| **System Settings** | Modify system security policies | ❌ (Forbidden) |

**Temporary Admin Behavior:**
- The Doctor's `isTempAdmin` flag is set to `true` with a `tempAdminExpiresAt` timestamp.
- The frontend promotes the Doctor's role to `Admin` in the AuthContext, redirecting them to the Admin dashboard.
- The sidebar displays both Admin items and Doctor-specific items under a "Doctor Access" divider.
- **Strict Restrictions:** Temporary Admins **cannot** approve leave requests, accept temp admin requests, manage system settings, or add new users. Restricted pages (User Management, System Settings, Admin Requests) are hidden from the sidebar and protected server-side with `403 Forbidden`.
- **Custom Time Limits & Auto-Logout:** Temporary admin access requests support custom duration inputs (Hours or Minutes). When the expiration time limit is reached, the session is **automatically logged out** and the user reverts to default permissions.
- Admins can manually revoke temporary access at any time via the Admin Requests page.

---

### **⏰ Off-Time (Shift-Based Restrictions)**

Shift-based access control is a core CAAC feature. Administrators assign shift windows (start/end times in `HH:MM` format) to Doctors and Nurses.

**How It Works:**
1. **Shift Assignment:** Admins set `shiftStart` and `shiftEnd` times for each Doctor/Nurse via the User Management page.
2. **Shift Evaluation:** The frontend utility `isUserInShift()` evaluates the current local time against the assigned shift window. Overnight shifts (e.g., 22:00 → 06:00) are handled correctly.
3. **Enforcement:** When a Doctor or Nurse is **outside their shift**, all write/edit actions are disabled in the UI (buttons are hidden or disabled). The user operates in **read-only mode**.
4. **No Shift = Unrestricted:** If no shift start/end is configured for a user, they default to always being in-shift (unrestricted access).

**Restrictions Applied When Off-Shift:**

| Action | Doctor (Off-Shift) | Nurse (Off-Shift) |
|---|---|---|
| View patient records | ✅ Read-only | ✅ Read-only |
| Edit vitals | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit medical history | ❌ | N/A (never allowed) |
| Update patient status | ❌ | N/A (never allowed) |
| Add timeline entries | ❌ | N/A (never allowed) |
| Add/Delete patients | ❌ | ❌ (requests blocked) |
| Approve/Reject Nurse requests | ❌ | N/A |
| Assign tasks to Nurses | ❌ | N/A |
| Request admin permissions | ❌ | N/A |

---

### **📅 Leave Days (Leave-Based Access Blocking)**

Leave management is a security feature that completely blocks system access for staff on approved leave.

**How It Works:**
1. **Leave Application:** Doctors and Nurses apply for leave by specifying start date, end date, and a reason.
2. **Admin Approval:** Administrators review and approve/reject leave requests.
3. **Login Blocking:** When a user with an **approved** leave covering today's date attempts to login, the system **blocks authentication** with the message: _"Access Denied: You are currently on leave."_
4. **API Middleware Blocking:** Even if a token is somehow obtained, the `authMiddleware` checks leave status on every authenticated request and denies access if the user is on leave without an active override.
5. **Emergency Access Override:** If a staff member on leave needs emergency access:
   - The user can submit an **Emergency Access Request** from the login page, selecting predefined options or entering a **custom time limit** of their choice in Hours or Minutes (along with email and reason).
   - All Admins receive a notification about the emergency request.
   - The **"Grant Emergency Access"** button on the Admin Leaves page is **only displayed when a doctor submits an emergency access request**.
   - An Admin can review the requested custom duration and grant an emergency override with predefined or custom duration in Hours or Minutes.
   - When the granted time limit expires, the active session is **automatically logged out** and the user reverts to default system permissions (login blocked).
   - Admins can also **revoke** an active emergency override at any time.

**Leave Day Permissions:**

| Action | Doctor/Nurse (On Leave) | With Emergency Override |
|---|---|---|
| Login to system | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |
| Access any API endpoint | ❌ Blocked | ✅ Allowed |
| Request emergency access | ✅ (from login page) | N/A |
| Normal role permissions | ❌ None | ✅ Full role permissions |

## **📊 Context-Aware Security Dimensions**

MedVault evaluates multiple contextual factors to make dynamic access control decisions:

### **1. Shift Schedule Context**
- Administrators assign `shiftStart` and `shiftEnd` times (HH:MM format) to Doctors and Nurses.
- The system evaluates the current time against the shift window on every page interaction.
- **Within Shift:** Full role-based read/write access is active.
- **Outside Shift:** Read-only access; all write actions are disabled in the UI.
- **Overnight Shifts:** The system correctly handles shifts that cross midnight (e.g., 22:00 → 06:00).

### **2. Leave Status Context**
- The `leaveChecker.js` utility queries approved leave requests covering today's date.
- **On Login:** Leave status is checked, blocking authentication for users on approved leave.
- **On Every Request:** The `authMiddleware` re-checks leave status, blocking API access mid-session if leave becomes active.
- **Emergency Override:** Time-limited override that temporarily allows access despite active leave.

### **3. Temporary Privilege Escalation Context**
- Doctors can request temporary admin access by selecting a target Admin and specifying a reason and duration (in minutes).
- The assigned Admin receives a notification and can approve/reject the request.
- On approval, the Doctor's user record is updated with `isTempAdmin: true` and a `tempAdminExpiresAt` timestamp.
- The frontend AuthContext detects this and promotes the Doctor to the Admin dashboard.
- Expiration is enforced both server-side (middleware checks) and client-side.

### **4. Inactivity Detection Context**
- A configurable inactivity timeout (default: 60 seconds) triggers a **blur overlay** that hides screen content.
- The overlay is dismissed immediately when the user interacts (mouse move, click, keypress).
- The timeout value is fetched from `SystemSettings` and can be adjusted by Admins.

---

## **🔒 Data Security Architecture**

### **Encryption (At Rest)**
- **Algorithm:** AES-256-CBC
- **Encrypted Patient Fields:** `age`, `disease`, `ward`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `guardianName`
- **Implementation:** Mongoose getter/setter hooks automatically encrypt on save and decrypt on retrieval.
- **Key Management:** 32-character encryption key stored in environment variables.

### **Data Masking (In Transit)**
- **Admin / Active Temp Admin:** Full access to all decrypted fields.
- **Doctor / Nurse:** Contact fields (`email`, `phone`, `address`, `guardianName`) are masked as `****`.
- **Masking Layer:** Applied server-side via `maskData.js` utility before sending API responses.

### **Authentication & Session Management**
- **Password Hashing:** bcryptjs with salt rounds of 10.
- **JWT Tokens:** Signed with configurable secret, role-based expiry (Admin: 24h, others: configurable minutes).
- **Session Expiry Overlay:** Frontend displays a session expired modal with a 5-second countdown before redirect.

### **Account Security**
- **Failed Login Tracking:** Each failed attempt is counted; upon reaching the configurable max attempts, the account is automatically locked.
- **Account Lockout:** Locked accounts cannot login until an Admin manually unlocks them.
- **Admin Notification:** All Admins are notified when an account is locked due to failed attempts.
- **Password Policy Enforcement:** When an Admin tightens password policies (increases min length or enables special characters), all non-Admin users are flagged to reset their passwords.
- **Compliance Dashboard:** Admins can view how many users still need to reset their passwords after a policy change.

## **⚠️ Important Notes**

- **Educational Purpose:** This is a demonstration system designed for academic research and cybersecurity education, not production-ready software.
- **No Real Data:** Use only synthetic data for testing. Do not store actual patient information.
- **Security Research:** Intended for defensive security education and Context-Aware Access Control research.
- **Default Credentials:** The seeded Admin account uses `admin@medvault.com` / `admin123`. Change these immediately in any non-local environment.
- **Encryption Key:** The default encryption key is for development only. Generate a secure 32-character key for any deployed instance.
